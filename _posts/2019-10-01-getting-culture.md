My father had a deep relationship with language. He could speak multiple  rustic dialects of Haryanvi or Punjabi, and then seamlessly switch to speaking impeccable Urdu to recite a couplet of Faiz. In his youth he was a news reader for the All India Radio, which might account for his refined Hindi, but it was in his childhood in Lahore that he studied Urdu and picked up the multiple dilects of Punjabi spoken in Lahore: Manji,Pothohari. He must have picked up Haryanvi when he arrived as a displaced person from Lahore after India's partition in 1947, and he learnt English when he studied for his MA in English in Delhi.  

His knack of languages made him a son on the soil. He could bond with local people just like that. He could  walk into a bureaucratic Indian office and talk to the babu in the babu's tongue and the babu's indifferent and haughty expression would break into a smile, and soon tea would be served, and my fathers files would be worked upon while a lively conversation flowed.  

My father was a very handsome man, tall and well built. He was often mistaken for the actor Guru Dutt. In his later years, he reverted to wearing the Pathani Salwar Kameez he used to wear in his youth in Lahore, which started a minor fashion trend in the small town we lived in. What was previously seen as a Muslim dress, became acceptable in our town and even became fashionable with the youth that saw it as a masculine dress. My father engaged a small time local tailor to stich his Salwar Kameez, for which he gave him instructions on the extra large size ghera (pleats) he desired. He dressed like this till he died at the age of 77.

We imbibed culture from my father by osmosis. With his Lohari dress that he proudly wore in a Hindu town; with the Hindustani music that he played on his tape recorder: Bagum Akthar, Bhimsen Joshi, Bada Gulim Ali, Ravi Shankar, Ustad Bismill Khan, Pandit Chaurasia; with his recitation of Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi poets: Faiz, Iqbal, Bacchan, Batalvi; he proudly lived the integration, the melting pot that is Hindustani culture. On his death bed, when he was in coma,  I played  Bhimsen Joshi's Krishna bhajans, which he enjoyed listening to, even though he was an  atheist. Growing up, Hindi, Urdu, and Punjabi were all our very own languages and the thought that Hindi is for India, Urdu for Pakistan was never in our mind. This was because of my father, the Hindustani who like a river flowed over from Lahore to Delhi, accumulating, assimilating  culture, dress and  languages, and bringing it together in his personality. Was this not how Hindavi developed into Hindi and Rekhta, then Urdu, I thought?

In his book [Beloved Delhi: A Mughal City and her Greatest Poets]( https://www.amazon.com/Beloved-Delhi-Mughal-Greatest-Poets/dp/9388326040), Saif Mahmood traces the evolution of our Hindavi language. The two main catalysts of change were Mahavira and the Buddha who, in the 6th  BCE challenged the hegemony of Sanskrit and started teaching in the natural language of the people: Prakrit. The purists who continued to maintain that only Sanskrit was the "language of the Gods" derisively referred to these emerging languages as *apabhramsas*, the fallen language, and one such language was *Shurseni*.

 A rough timeline of the emergence of Hindi & Urdu is as follows:

**6 BCE** : Prakrit evolves.

Mahavira and the Buddha teach in Prakrit.

**1 BCE**: Shurseni evolves.

Shurseni, a "fallen language", an *apabhramsas* evolves.

**1179 to 1266 CE** : Sufis 

Baba Sheikh Fareed lived in Multan. He was the founder of Chisti Sufi order. The influence of the Sufis on our spiritual and cultural life continues to resonate well over 800 years after the first of them set foot in Hindustan.  "The doors of the Sufi khanqah (hospice or monastery) were open to all creeds, classes and castes. The khanqahs became centres of dialogue, debate and exchange of ideas and of music and poetry. This culture of inclusion and openness produced some of the finest literature and music of the medieval period. The Sufis, who mostly spoke Turki, Persian, Dari or Pashto, wished to communicate with the growing number of new adherents in their own languages. As they travelled far and wide and settled across the length and breadth of the subcontinent, they acquired new languages. Those who settled in Punjab and Multan and neighboring areas chose Saraiki, Sindhi, Multani and Punjabi as the languages of their discourse, just as those who travelled to the east chose Awadhi.” (1)

**12 CE to 14 CE**: Evolution of various strains of language, 

In this period, the speakers of the Indo-Iranian languages principally, Turkish, Persian and Pashto moved into North India and into Delhi, seeking the famed wealth of Hindustan. "Among the new arrivals were traders, men of faith and adventurers. The new arrivals brought with them new lifestyles and knowledge systems, all of which began to be gradually absorbed, adapted and appropriated by the older inhabitants of the subcontinent. This interaction between two civilizational streams, the Central Asian and the South Asian, led to hybridization of all markers of cultural identity and eventually to the emergence of new music, architecture, cuisines, attires, etiquettes of social discourse and—most important, in the context of this essay—new languages." (1) 

A number of languages and tongues  development in this period include:

1. Hindavi: During this period, the evolving, hybrid language spoken here, often referred to as *Hindavi* or Hindi, moved to Gujarat, Deogiri, Deccan, Gulbarga, Golconda, Bijapur, Aurangabad and returned, richer and more vibrant, to Delhi again. 
2. Lashkari:  the language of the Lashkar, the army camp also evolved at this time. Its grammar and syntax relied on local usage but its vocabulary drew many words and phrases from Turki, Farsi, Dari and Pashto. Sandooq, bandooq, tafang, zarrah baktar, band-o-bast, kamaan, kamaandaar, sipahi, pyada, gasht (trunk, gun, muzzle-loaded rifle, armour, arrangement, bow, commander, sepoy, foot soldier, beat) and hundreds of other words travelled and became a part of the vocabulary of common people as soldiers dispersed after battles and returned to their villages. 
3. Saraiki : Sarai ki Zabaan—the language of the sarai—or Saraiki evolved in this period. Sufi influence was predominant. The doors of the Sufi khanqah (hospice or monastery) were open to all creeds, classes and castes. "The khanqahs became centres of dialogue, debate and exchange of ideas and of music and poetry. This culture of inclusion and openness produced some of the finest literature and music of the medieval period. The Sufis, who mostly spoke Turki, Persian, Dari or Pashto, wished to communicate with the growing number of new adherents in their own languages. As they travelled far and wide and settled across the length and breadth of the subcontinent, they acquired new languages. Those who settled in Punjab and Multan and neighbouring areas chose Saraiki, Sindhi, Multani and Punjabi as the languages of their discourse, just as those who travelled to the east chose Awadhi.” (1)

**1253 CE - 1325 CE** : Amir Khusro lived in Delhi

Amir Khusro belonged to the Chisti Sufi set, was the disciple  of Nizamuddin Auliya, who was the successor of Baba Sheik Farid. He was instrumental in giving shape to Hindavi, the language that split into Hindi and Urdu.

“Khusrau is the first—and best—known poet of Hindavi, the language that was to later evolve and, unfortunately, get divided into Hindi and Urdu. These two languages, the music and poetry of India—especially of North India—and much of what went into making us an inclusive society, owes a lot to Khusrau.” (1)

**16018 CE - 1707**:  Aurangzeb rules.

**1700 CE**: Dakhani or Rekhta (Urdu) evolves

Hindavi had spread from Delhi to present-day Gujarat to different parts of the Deccan, absorbing words, phrases and expressions from Gujarati, Marathi, Telugu and Kannada and enriching these languages, too, with words, expressions and phrases from Hindavi, Gojri, Persian, Dari and Turkish. This exchange and intermingling gradually led to the rise of a dialect called *Dakhani*—a flexible, adaptive language of daily life in large parts of the Deccan. The Sufis are believed to be the first group of people to write in this language

In 1700 CE, Dakhani arrived in Delhi as an almost fully developed language with the poetry of *Wali Dakhn*i. Dakhani, the language in which Wali wrote, was derisively called ‘*Rekhta*’ or mixed language. It was considered a language of the marketplace and therefore lacking refinement and unfit for civilized discourse.  All the master poets of Delhi were soon trying their hand at writing in a language that had started life in their own city and virtually been a gypsy for 350 years, before returning to the land of its birth. The story of Urdu as we know it today begins here.
