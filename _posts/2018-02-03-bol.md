*Speak!*

for your lips are still free...

*Speak!*

for the tongue is still yours.

That virile body that is yours--

*Speak!*

For life is still yours.

*See:*

in the blacksmith's shop,

fierce the flames, red the anvil,

the forge: its hungry jaws widening,

the chains: its lap, inviting--

*Speak!*

for this short time is enough

before body & tongue's demise.

*Speak!*

for truth is still alive.

*Speak!*

whatever you want to say... speak it!
