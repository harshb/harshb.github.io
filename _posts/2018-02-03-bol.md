**Translated from Urdu by Hersh**

*Speak!*

for your lips are still free.

*Speak!*

for the tongue is still yours.

That virile body that is yours:

*Speak!*

for life is still yours.

*See!*

in the blacksmith's shop,

fierce the flames, red the anvil.

The forge: its hungry jaws widening

the chains: its lap, inviting.

*Speak!*

for this short time is enough

before body & tongue's demise.

*Speak!*

for truth is still alive.

*Speak!*

whatever you want to say... speak it!
