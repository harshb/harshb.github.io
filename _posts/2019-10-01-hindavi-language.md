My father had a deep relationship with language. He could speak multiple  rustic dilects of Haryanvi or Punjabi, and then seamlessly switch and recite couplets from Faiz in impeccable Urdu. In his youth he was a news reader for the All India Radio, which might account for his refined Hindi, but it was in his childhood in Lahore that he studied Urdu and picked up the multiple dilects of Punjabi spoken in Lahore: Manji,Pothohari. He must have picked up Haryanvi when he arrived as a displaced person from Lahore after India's partition in 1947 and he learnt English when he studied for his MA in English in Delhi.  

His knack of languages made him a son on the soil. He could bond with people just like that. He could  walk into a bureaucratic Indian office and talk to the babu in his local dilect and the babu's indifferent and haughty expression would break into smiles and soon tea would be served, and my fathers files would be worked upon while a lively conversation flowed.  

My father was a very handsome man, tall and well built. He was often mistaken for the actor Guru Dutt. In his later years, he went back to wearing the Pathani Salwar Kameez he used to wear in his youth in Lahore and started a minor fashion trend in the small town we lived in. Which was previously seen as a Muslim dress, became acceptable in our town and even became fashionable with the youth that saw it as a masculine dress. My father engaged a small time local tailor to stich his Salwar Kameez, for which he gave him instructions on the extra large size ghera (pleats) he desired. He dressed like this till he died at the age of 77.

We imbibed culture from my father by osmosis. With his dress, with the Hindustani music that he played on his tape recorder, and on his car stereo: Bagum Akthar, Bhimsen Joshi, Bada Gulim Ali, Ravi Shankar, Ustad Bismill Khan, Pandit Chaurasia; with his Urdu poetry: Faiz, Iqbal, he proudly lived the integration that is Hindustani culture.
