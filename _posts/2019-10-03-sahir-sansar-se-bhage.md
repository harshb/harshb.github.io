Sahir Ludhianvi's poem,  "Sansār Se Bhāge Phirte Ho Bhagvān Ko Tum Kyā Pāoge" :  Escaping the world, do you think you will  find God

**Translation by Hersh**



You, who from the world seeks to flee

Think you will get God this way? Really?



This earthy world that you wouldn't accept

What makes you think that starry realm too you will not reject?



What is piety? and what is sin?

If not the stamp  on convention by a church.



From these ever changing churches

On which church's tune will you march?



I say this world belongs to us

You say this word is a false dream.



I will live my birth and leave

You will loose your birth and grieve.
