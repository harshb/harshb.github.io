>   You, who from the world seeks to flee
>
>   Think in this way you will God see?
>
>This earthy world  you couldn't accept
>   
>That starry realm too will also disappoint, you'll see.
>   
>
>What is piety? and what is sin?
>   
>If not the stamp  on convention by a church.
>   
>From these ever changing churches
>   
>On which church's tune will you march?
>   
>I say this world belongs to us
>   
>You say this word is a false dream.
>   
>I will live my birth and leave
>   
>You will loose your birth and grieve.
>   
>*Translated by Hersh Bhasin*
