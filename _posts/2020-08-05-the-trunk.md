The trunk stood in the empty shed outside our house. My papa used to rear chicken in this shed , when he had his poultry farm, but now it was empty. It was a massive aluminum trunk, almost six feet long and four feet high. Bricks placed under it on its four sides elevated it off the ground, probably to try and safeguard it from the big rats that fearlessly roamed the shed at night. It had a huge latch, which would fall with a bang on the hook when you tried to lift the lid. You had to hold the latch up with a hand, as you pushed the trunk’s lid open. The aluminum lid was depressed in the middle and when it opened, you had to be sure to jam the lid right back, till the levers that attached the lid to the base were taunt, else the lid would fall on your head, as you riffled around in trunk.

The trunk had always been there and I have no recollection of my papa purchasing it and bringing it home. It could have been purchased before my birth, or, which is more probable, could have been part of my mother’s dowry. Whatever the means of acquisition, it was always there, all through my childhood, through my adolescence, and right up to my college days. It was my personal Goodwill store, my own Salvation Army store. Whenever I had an occasion to dress up for, I would dip into the Trunk and pull out a shirt, a trouser, or even a dress suit . I knew of brands like Harrods, Selfridges, Harvey Nichols, Morris Communications, J Sainsbury from the labels on the garments, for my rich relatives shopped mostly in London.

That the oversized gaudy suit, with its massive lapels, or the double breasted blazer with its huge comic buttons, or the bell bottom trouser with its oversized flair was years out of date, I had no clue. And then, there was no one to tell me so. In my middle class friends circle, I, with my retrofitted clothes from the trunk, was probably more fashionable than them.

How the “branded” hand-me-downs made their way into the trunk, and how its quantity was periodically replenished, I do not know. I do not recall ever seeing the hand-me-downs actually coming into the house. It would have to be my maternal grandmother, my Nani, who would have been the courier. My maternal grandparents visited us from Kenya every year. Their visits became even more frequent when I was in high school. This was the time my Papa slipped in and out of depression and they would spend many months with us in Chandigarh. I expect that my Nani gathered up all the discards from my two maternal uncles and brought them to India.

The changing waistlines of my two rich uncles could be traced in varying waist sizes of the trousers in the trunk. Fashions of all bygone years were represented here: there were trousers with the large bell bottom flares of the sixties; you could find drainpipe trousers of the Beatles era here; there were double breasted blazers with large lapels, with bronze sailor buttons that must have been fashionable in some decade.

The white suite that I wore at my college graduation came from this trunk. My friend and classmate at college, Mohit borrowed my black blazer to wear at the graduation. That too was extracted from the trunk. In college I was thin like a stick, a scarecrow. The suit and the blazer belonged to my uncle who was huge. But that was no problem, for alteration of garments in those days was cheap. The brick red wool suit I wore to my eldest sisters marriage also came from the trunk. It was also altered to fit my lean frame by the Sector 28 tailor. I wore it proudly to my sisters marriage, which was held at my maternal uncle’s house in Kenya: the same uncle whose discard the red suit was. He recognized the suit. Watching the well heeled Kenyan Punjabis at the wedding, I realized that its style was out of fashion; and that a flaming brick-red wool coat is not really a suitable attire for a formal occasion like a wedding.
