# Translation by Hersh Bhasin



We shall witness.

It's Imperative  that we too shall witness:

</br>

that day promised to us till now,

that iron clad dictate writ in the lines of our brow.

</br>

When these mountains of  tyranny, torment and unrest,

will dissipate like shreds of cotton in a tempest.

</br>

Under the feet of we, the subjugated,

this earth will pulse and throb unabated.

</br>

And over the heads of these philosophers false,

lightening will crackle, snap and waltz.

</br>

When  in the land of the pure,

the  false idols are no more.

</br>

We the pure of heart, who the fundamentalists decry.

We will take seats up high.

</br>

All crowns will be flung.

All thrones wrung.

</br>

Only the True One's name will remain.

The One who is invisible, yet visible.

</br>

Who is the spectacle,

and the beholder.

</br>

"I am Truth.. I am Truth":  this thundering chant will roar:

that is me, and  its you for sure.

</br>

And,  the pure hearted people will rule:

that is me, and  its you for sure.
