## Windemere

The **[Ernest Hemingway Cottage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway_Cottage)**, also known as **Windemere**, was the boyhood summer home of author [Ernest Hemingway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway), on [Walloon Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walloon_Lake) in Michigan. Ernest Hemingway, born in 1899, spent every summer here from 1900 - 1920, save 1918. Hemingway used the northern Michigan setting in a number of his works.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway_Cottage#cite_note-nom-6) This cottage appears in "[The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctor_and_the_Doctor's_Wife)," "Ten Indians," "The Indians Moved Away," "The Last Good Country," and "[Wedding Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_Day_(short_story))."

After his mother died, Hemingway was willed the cottage. Although he did not visit, he retained ownership until his own death in 1961. At his request, Hemingway's widow signed over ownership of the cottage to his younger sister Madelaine, who used it until her own death. It later passed to Hemingway's nephew, Ernie Mainland, who still owned the cottage as of 2015.

A few house away from the Hemmingway Cottage is small play park and it opens up to the  Walloon lake. You are almost sitting on the steps of Hemmingway's cottage.
