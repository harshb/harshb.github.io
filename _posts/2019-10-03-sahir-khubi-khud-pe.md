Sahir Ludhanvi's poem, ""Kabhī Khud Pe Kabhī Hālāt Pe Ronā Aayā" . 

> I cry at myself, then at my fate
>
> Who cry's for another pain my friend...
>
> Everyone cries in remembrance of their own pain. 

See how deep this poem is, and with what economy of words is the idea expressed: that when you relate your pain to another and he cries, he does not cry because he has empathy for you but because something in your painful story made him remember a similar pain that he had suffered, and he cries because of that.
